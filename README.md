# Drill
Drill is the desktop application on C++(Qt) that draws a projection of the trajectory of the drill on the XY coordinate plane.
The projection is based on data from a json file. 
The <<azimuth> > field allows you to enter the azimuth of the plane. When it changes, the projection reverses in real time.
The graphic scene can be scaled, which allows you to see the entire trajectory of the movement.

C++14, Qt 5.5+
